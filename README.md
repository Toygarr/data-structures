### This repository includes my data structure codes written in C lang. to utilize concepts faster.

Because of the university restrictions I escape from using global variables so you will see the usage of address passing to change local variables in most of the codes. In other resources, they mostly prefer using global variables to make it easier to code.

We can use arrays, linked lists and heap trees to implement ```priority queue``` so it has no special implementation. For example, heap tree is available to use directly as a priority queue. In max-heap trees, we are aware of the first element of tree is the biggest. We can simply use that algorithm to realize priority queue efficiently.

**Important:** Please note that there may some mistakes and incomplete codes. Some homeworks may have few bugs in extreme cases due to C language problems with files and short homework deadlines. Feel free to correct me if you find proper solution for those cases.
